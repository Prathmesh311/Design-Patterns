# Java Design Patterns Projects â¬¡

---

This repository contains a Java project demonstrating various design patterns as specified in the "Gang of Four" book and other commonly used design patterns. Each design pattern is implemented as a separate module within the project, and the module name corresponds to the design pattern being demonstrated.

## Introduction

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems encountered in software design. They provide a template for solving problems in a particular way, offering a structured approach to design and development. Understanding and implementing design patterns can lead to more efficient, maintainable, and scalable code.

This project aims to provide a practical demonstration of various design patterns in Java. Each design pattern is implemented in a separate module, making it easy to understand and test individual patterns.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:
