# Builder Design Pattern

---

This module demonstrates the Builder Design Pattern in Java.

## Introduction

The Builder Design Pattern is a creational design pattern used to construct complex objects step by step. It allows the construction of a complex object to be separated from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

## How it Works

The Builder pattern involves the following components:

1. **Director**: Responsible for using the Builder interface to construct objects. It controls the construction process by calling the appropriate methods on the Builder interface.

2. **Builder**: An interface or abstract class that defines the steps and methods for constructing the product. It provides methods for setting the different parts of the product.

3. **Concrete Builder**: Implements the Builder interface to provide specific implementations for building the product. It constructs and assembles the parts of the product by implementing the Builder interface.

4. **Product**: Represents the complex object being constructed. It is the final object that is created by the Builder.

## Implementation

In this module, you'll find an example implementation of the Builder Design Pattern. It demonstrates how to use the Builder pattern to construct a complex object, such as a `UserDTO` object consisting of different components like a name, address, and age.

## How to Use

To use this module:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `BuilderPattern` directory.
3. Review the source code to understand the implementation of the Builder Design Pattern.
4. Compile and run the Java program to see the Builder pattern in action.
